## Overview
 
While making this project I learned how to build function-based views, build a data model, set up the database, how to use Django's ORM, and customize the Admin site.

I dove into implementation of Django Rest Framework to build a RESTful API, learned more about API concepts (nested routers, pagination, filtering, searching), switched over from function-base views to viewsets while learning how they build upon each other through generic views and mixins, learned how to secure API with Djoser and JWT while applying custom permissions, and continued building the application by adding a functional shopping cart and order endpoints.

Finally I implemented uploading, validating, and returning media, using a fake SMTP server, running background tasks with Celery and Redis, testing the application's behaviour, not implementation, stress-testing our application with Locust and investigating it with Silk, the benefits of caching using Redis, reconfiguring our project to make it production-ready, and deploying our project to Heroku.
